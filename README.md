# Financial-LLM

This project fine-tunes **BART (facebook/bart-large-cnn)** on a financial news dataset to generate concise and domain-specific summaries. It leverages **Hugging Face Transformers** for training and evaluation, with **ROUGE metrics** used to assess summarization quality. The model is deployed using **FastAPI**, allowing real-time summarization of financial news articles.
